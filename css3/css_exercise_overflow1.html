<h1>CSS overflow, Exercise 1</h1>
      <p>Add a scrollbar to the &lt;div&gt; element.</p>
<pre>
<code>
&#60;html&#62;
&#60;head&#62;
&#60;style&#62;
div {
  background-color: #eee;
  width: 200px;
  height: 70px;
  border: 1px dotted black;
  overflow: scroll;
}
&#60;/style&#62;
&#60;/head&#62;
&#60;body&#62;

&#60;div&#62;
  &#60;p&#62;In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.&#60;/p&#62;
  &#60;p&#62;'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/div&#62;

&#60;/body&#62;
&#60;/html&#62;
