  &#60;p&#62;In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.&#60;/p&#62;
  &#60;p&#62;'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;/div&#62;
